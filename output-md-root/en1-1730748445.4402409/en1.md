where $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ are the two images being compared, ${\mathbf u}=( u, v )$ is the displacem $w ( {\bf x} )$ is a spatially varying weighting (or window) function, and the summation $i$ the pixels in the patch. Note that this is the same formulation we later use to estim between complete images (Section 9.1).

When performing feature detection, we do not know which other image loc feature will end up being matched against. Therefore, we can only compute how
